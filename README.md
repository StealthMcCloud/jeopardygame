Basic Ideas

Create a grid that allows it to show all the cells that would be in a jeopardy game.

There will need to be 6 categories going from the left to right.

Underneath the categories there will need to be dollar values to the clues that will be given.  It will range from 100 to 500 an this will be a 6 X 5 grid.

Under each category there will need to be a matching clues to the category and when the dollar value is clicked it will reveal the clue and allow you to answer.

There will need to be a function to check what you typed to the answer and verify that they match and have basic spell checking.

Maybe include a timer that will cause the players to answer quickly.

Have a score counter that will keep track of what the player gets.  Maybe a way to subtract values and add values.

Make the boxes pop out a bit almost as if they are on screens

Do I want the clue to just appear in the box or somewhere else?

Have a way for the player to enter their name.

Make it look like a jeopardy stage?
